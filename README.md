IO-Tester-for-C-Cpp
===================

A simple pyqt based interface for linux based systems to run C/C++ programs, measure execution time for given inputs. Supports Syntax highlighting too.
To run the program, just change directory to the main directory containing the interface and its dependancies, and run the file Interface2.py.
The application provides file-open and save facilities, and a compile log. An approximate execution time is shown at the end of each execution.
